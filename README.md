In this repository I'll try to put the solutions to some problems in the project euler page, this is web page with mathematical problems, which aim is to solving them in a optimal computational form.
I'll use python like the base programming language. 

Each script has a problem description and a posible solution for this. If you have a better solution, please share it with me.
